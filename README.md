# Distributed Computing System using Python and Socket Programming

## Introduction
The Distributed Computing System is a Python-based application that enables resource sharing between two computers on the same Local Area Network (LAN). It allows users to harness the collective computational power of multiple machines to perform computationally intensive tasks efficiently. This system is designed to distribute and coordinate computational workloads across connected peers, promoting collaborative and efficient resource utilization.

## Features
- **Resource Sharing:** Share computational resources (e.g., CPU, GPU) between connected computers to speed up data processing and computation-heavy tasks.
- **User-friendly Interface:** An intuitive command-line interface makes it easy to interact with the system and monitor task progress.
